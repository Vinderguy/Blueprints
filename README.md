<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Blueprints datapack combine the use of `doLimitedCrafting` gamerule and knowledge book item. You start the game with only a few blueprints (recipes) unlocked and you can't craft anything else unless you find a blueprint for it. Blueprints (knowledge books) can be obtained in various ways at various places (see [How To Play](#how-to-play) section). Found ones can be learned by right-clicking while holding them. Learned blueprints last forever and allow you to craft item that you have learned blueprint for.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Blueprints in your Minecraft world:

1. [Download](https://github.com/Vinderguy/Blueprints/releases/tag/v1.1) the latest Blueprints release for the Minecraft version you use.
2. Extract downloaded archive.
3. Copy `blueprints` folder from `datapacks` to your Minecraft world's datapacks directory:\
`
%appdata%\.minecraft\saves\[YOUR WORLD NAME]\datapacks
`
4. Copy `blueprints` folder from `resourcepacks` to your Minecraft resourcepacks directory:\
`
%appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks
`
5. Turn on Blueprints resourcepack in game settings.
6. Rejoin world or open chat and type: `/reload`



<!-- HOW TO PLAY -->
## How To Play

1. You start the game with only several common blueprints unlocked. You can't craft anything else.

2. There are 3 tiers of blueprints: Tier 1 (green), Tier 2 (blue), Tier 3 (red). Tier 1 is the most most common tier and can be found almost everywhere, while the rarest Tier 3 blueprints can be found only in the end. Each tier has its set of items (see [documentation](https://github.com/Vinderguy/Blueprints/wiki) for more details).

**IMPORTANT** : While the diamond pickaxe is tier 3 item you an still build nether portal using buckets.

3. Right-click blueprints to unlock them.
